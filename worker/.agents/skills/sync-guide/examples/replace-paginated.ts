/**
 * Replace mode — paginated API.
 *
 * Fetches all records page by page. Each cycle re-fetches everything.
 * The runtime deletes any records not seen during the cycle.
 *
 * This pattern is also used for backfill syncs (with schedule: "manual"),
 * where you want to re-import all data on demand rather than on a timer.
 *
 * Key points:
 * - State is just within-cycle pagination: { page: number }
 * - State effectively resets between cycles (each cycle starts from page 1)
 * - hasMore: true while there are more pages to fetch
 * - Batch size ~100 to avoid overloading a single execute call
 * - A pacer rate-limits API calls to avoid hitting upstream rate limits

/**
 * Replace mode — static data, no pagination.
 *
 * The simplest possible sync. Returns hardcoded data with no API calls.
 * Good for: testing the sync setup, syncing small static datasets.
 *
 * Key points:
 * - mode: "replace" means the runtime deletes any records not returned each cycle
 * - No state needed — there's no pagination and no cursor
 * - hasMore: false on every call — single-page cycle
 * - Database is declared separately via worker.database() and referenced by handle

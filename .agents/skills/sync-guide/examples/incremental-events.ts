/**
 * Delta sync — event-feed pattern (Stripe-style).
 *
 * This is the delta half of a backfill+delta pair. It reads from an events/
 * changelog endpoint to detect changes incrementally. A separate replace-mode
 * backfill sync (not shown here) handles the full dataset load.
 *
 * The event feed provides a reliable change stream: each event has a unique ID
 * that serves as a cursor. Events can produce both upserts and deletes.
 *
 * Key points:
 * - State is just { eventCursor: string } — no phase discrimination
 * - First run: fetch the latest event ID as the starting cursor
 * - Consistency buffer: skip events younger than 10 seconds (they may not be
 *   fully consistent yet, and since the cursor never resets, skipping = permanent loss)
 * - Events can map to both upserts and deletes
 *
 * For the backfill half, use a replace-mode sync targeting the same database —
 * see replace-paginated.ts for the pattern. Trigger it via CLI:
 *   ntn workers sync state reset customersBackfill && ntn workers sync trigger customersBackfill
